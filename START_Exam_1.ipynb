If it is hard, I recommend starting with a very simple model - can you simulate one customer? Can we simulate one day of customers? Can we simulate one year of days? <b>Build a simple model and make it more accurate incrementally</b>, doing it all at once can be hard, doing it piece by piece is easier. \n",
